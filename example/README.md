# example

This is an example for using `react-component-form` inside a Next.js application with translations thanks to [next-translate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-translate).

The application shows how to use the `<Form />` component with the `useForm` hook to validate and submit a form with a `name` input and an `email` input.

The interesting code is in [./components/FormExample.tsx](./components/FormExample.tsx).
